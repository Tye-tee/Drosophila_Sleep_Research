# The Effect of Sleep Quantity on Neurological Behavior of *Drosophila melanogaster*

 *Undergraduate Neuroscience Research Project*  
**Author:** Titilayo Kuloyo  
**Semester:** Spring 2021

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sleep response behavior of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) using EthoVision XT. The goal was to quantify sleep durations and patterns across various genetic lines under controlled conditions, and compare those behaviors to established sleep-related studies.

Note: Due to confidentiality, the dataset is not publicly available. The PowerPoint presentation contains screenshots of the data acquisition interface, behavioral timelines, and result visualizations.


## Research Question

**Is there a correlation between sleep and neurological behavior?**  
This study explores whether sleep quantity affects exploratory behavior and attention patterns in *Drosophila* and ultimately in humans. 

##  Methods

- **Model Organism:** *Drosophila melanogaster*
- **Software:** Ethovision XT for automated behavioral tracking
- **Variables:** Distance moved, mobility frequency, time in zone

## Analysis Workflow
### Data Acquisition

- Behavioral tracking was conducted using EthoVision XT, a video-tracking software.

- Flies were placed in pre-defined zones, and movement data was collected over a set observation window.

- Sleep was defined as sustained inactivity beyond a specific threshold (industry standard: ≥5 minutes).

### Data Processing & Cleaning

- Raw EthoVision output was parsed to isolate activity/inactivity periods for each fly.

- Data was segmented by sleep line, experimental group, and time window (e.g., light/dark cycles).

- Unreliable data points (e.g., tracking noise, malformed timestamps) were removed.

### Summary Statistics & Aggregation

- Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and range of sleep durations per fly line.

- Aggregated sleep data by genotype, allowing for comparison across experimental conditions.

- Line-level comparisons allowed us to isolate genetically-induced sleep phenotype differences.

### Benchmarking with Literature

- Compared results to known sleep baseline metrics from peer-reviewed Drosophila sleep studies.

- Evaluated deviation from control strains and checked alignment with known short-sleeper and long-sleeper models.

 ### Visual Evidence
**While raw data is confidential, the presentation contains:**

- Screenshots of EthoVision software interface

- Activity heat maps and behavioral sector definitions

- Charts comparing sleep metrics across fly lines

- Annotated comparisons with baseline literature findings

## Key Results

- Long sleep lines exhibited **greater exploratory activity**.
- Short sleep lines showed **decreased mobility** over time.
- Statistically significant variation (p < 0.05) across sleep genotypes.

## Reflection

This project strengthened my ability to design structured data experiments, visualize complex time-series data, and translate biological behavior into actionable insights. I gained hands-on experience using behavioral tracking tools, while managing multiple timelines under real-world constraints—skills directly applicable to operational analytics, clinical data workflows, and digital health environments.
