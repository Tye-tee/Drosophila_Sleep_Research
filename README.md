# The Effect of Sleep Quantity on Neurological Behavior of *Drosophila melanogaster*

 *Undergraduate Neuroscience Research Project*  
**Author:** Titilayo Kuloyo  
**Semester:** Spring 2021

## Overview

This research investigates the correlation between sleep quantity and neurological behavior in *Drosophila melanogaster* using open-field assays and video tracking analysis. The study leverages genetically modified fly lines to model neurological responses under varying sleep conditions.

## Research Question

**Is there a correlation between sleep and neurological behavior?**  
This study explores whether sleep quantity affects exploratory behavior and attention patterns in *Drosophila* and ultimately in humans. 

##  Methods

- **Model Organism:** *Drosophila melanogaster*
- **Software:** Ethovision XT for automated behavioral tracking
- **Variables:** Distance moved, mobility frequency, time in zone

##  Skills Demonstrated

### Research & Scientific Methodology
- Experimental design using model organisms
- Behavioral neuroscience and sleep research
- Literature review and academic referencing

### Technical Tools & Analysis
- EthoVision XT (video tracking & analysis)
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning and processing)
- Data visualization and trend analysis
- PowerPoint (scientific presentation design)

### Analytical Thinking
- Interpreting behavioral data in biological context
- Identifying significant trends and correlations
- Statistical insight (significance levels, trend lines)

### Communication & Presentation
- Translating complex data into visuals and insights
- Scientific writing and structured storytelling
- Delivering academic presentations with confidence


## Key Results

- Long sleep lines exhibited **greater exploratory activity**.
- Short sleep lines showed **decreased mobility** over time.
- Statistically significant variation (p < 0.05) across sleep genotypes.
