# The Effect of Sleep Quantity on Neurological Behavior of *Drosophila melanogaster*

 *Undergraduate Neuroscience Research Project*  
**Author:** Titilayo Kuloyo  
**Semester:** Spring 2021

## Overview

This research investigates the correlation between sleep quantity and neurological behavior in *Drosophila melanogaster* using open-field assays and video tracking analysis. The study leverages genetically modified fly lines to model neurological responses under varying sleep conditions.

## Research Question

**Is there a correlation between sleep and neurological behavior?**  
This study explores whether sleep quantity affects exploratory behavior and attention patterns in *Drosophila* and ultimately in humans. 

##  Methods

- **Model Organism:** *Drosophila melanogaster*
- **Software:** Ethovision XT for automated behavioral tracking
- **Variables:** Distance moved, mobility frequency, time in zone

## Key Results

- Long sleep lines exhibited **greater exploratory activity**.
- Short sleep lines showed **decreased mobility** over time.
- Statistically significant variation (p < 0.05) across sleep genotypes.

## Reflection

This project deepened my understanding of experimental design, data visualization, and biological modeling. It also honed my skills in behavioral tracking software and time management in research.

## Future Work

Expanding the genetic scope of the sleep lines, applying machine learning for pattern recognition in movement, and comparing to human sleep behavior models.
